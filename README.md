- 👋 Hi, I’m @DQNOK
- 👀 I’m interested in some data algorithms, and in making teaching videos.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that getting a new job as a programmer after age 60 is impossible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my quasi-balanced binary tree.
- 📫 How to reach me is currently unknown to me.  I'll edit this after I've figured out GitHub.
